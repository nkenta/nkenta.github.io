                <p>BYU-Idaho accepts qualified students of various talents and backgrounds to balance the student body across each semester of the school’s three-track admissions system. Admission is granted without regard to race, color, gender, national
                    origin, age, or disability, provided that the applicant meets the university’s admission requirements, including being ecclesiastically endorsed as an individual worthy to attend a school within the Church Educational System; agrees
                    to abide by the Church Educational System Honor Code, including the Dress and Grooming Standards; and is otherwise qualified as determined by university policy. International applicants also must adhere to all federal immigration laws
                    and regulations, including providing an affidavit of financial support and submitting a $4,000 deposit prior to being issued an I-20.</p>
